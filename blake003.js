BLAKE003 = ["Eno aged Mother","Who the chariot of Leutha guides","Since the day of thunders in old time","Sitting beneath the eternal Oak","Trembled and shook the stedfast Earth","And thus her speech broke forth","O Times remote","When Love and joy were adoration","And none impure were deemd","Not Eyeless Covet","Nor Thinlipd Envy","Nor Bristled Wrath","Nor Curled Wantonness","But Covet was poured full","Envy fed with fat of lambs","Wrath with lions gore","Wantonness lulld to sleep","With the virgins lute","Or sated with her love","Till Covet broke his locks and bars","And slept with open doors","Envy sung at the rich mans feast","Wrath was followd up and down","By a little ewe lamb","And Wantonness on his own true love","Begot a giant race","Raging furious the flames of desire","Ran thro heaven and earth living flames","Intelligent organizd armd","With destruction and plagues In the midst","The Eternal Prophet bound in a chain","Compelld to watch Urizens shadow","Ragd with curses and sparkles of fury","Round the flames roll as Los hurls his chains","Mounting up from his fury condensd","Rolling round and round mounting on high","Into vacuum into nonentity","Where nothing was dashd wide apart","His feet stamp the eternal fierceraging","Rivers of wide flame they roll round","And round on all sides making their way","Into darkness and shadowy obscurity","Wide apart stood the fires Los remaind","In the void between fire and fire","In trembling and horror they beheld him","They stood wide apart drivn by his hands","And his feet which the nether abyss","Stampd in fury and hot indignation","But no light from the fires all was","Darkness round Los heat was not for bound up","Into fiery spheres from his fury","The gigantic flames trembled and hid","O Coldness darkness obstruction a Solid","Without fluctuation hard as adamant","Black as marble of Egypt impenetrable","Bound in the fierce raging Immortal","And the seperated fires froze in","A vast solid without fluctuation","Bound in his expanding clear senses","The Immortal stood frozen amidst","The vast rock of eternity times","And times a night of vast durance","Impatient stifled stiffend hardned","Till impatience no longer could bear","The hard bondage rent rent the vast solid","With a crash from immense to immense","Crackd across into numberless fragments","The Prophetic wrath strugling for vent","Hurls apart stamping furious to dust","And crumbling with bursting sobs heaves","The black marble on high into fragments","Hurld apart on all sides as a falling","Rock the innumerable fragments away","Fell asunder and horrible vacuum","Beneath him and on all sides round","Falling falling Los fell and fell","Sunk precipitant heavy down down","Times on times night on night day on day","Truth has bounds Error none falling falling","Years on years and ages on ages","Still he fell thro the void still a void","Found for falling day and night without end","For tho day or night was not their spaces","Were measurd by his incessant whirls","In the horrid vacuity bottomless","The Immortal revolving indignant","First in wrath threw his limbs like the babe","New born into our world wrath subsided","And contemplative thoughts first arose","Then aloft his head reard in the Abyss","And his downwardborne fall changd oblique","Many ages of groans till there grew","Branchy forms organizing the Human","Into finite inflexible organs","Till in process from falling he bore","Sidelong on the purple air wafting","The weak breeze in efforts oerwearied","Incessant the falling Mind labourd","Organizing itself till the Vacuum","Became element pliant to rise","Or to fall or to swim or to fly","With ease searching the dire vacuity","The Lungs heave incessant dull and heavy","For as yet were all other parts formless","Shivring clinging around like a cloud","Dim and glutinous as the white Polypus","Drivn by waves and englobd on the tide","And the unformed part cravd repose","Sleep began the Lungs heave on the wave","Weary overweighd sinking beneath","In a stifling black fluid he woke","He arose on the waters but soon","Heavy falling his organs like roots","Shooting out from the seed shot beneath","And a vast world of waters around him","In furious torrents began","Then he sunk and around his spent Lungs","Began intricate pipes that drew in","The spawn of the waters Outbranching","An immense Fibrous form stretching out","Thro the bottoms of immensity raging","He rose on the floods then he smote","The wild deep with his terrible wrath","Seperating the heavy and thin","Down the heavy sunk cleaving around","To the fragments of solid up rose","The thin flowing round the fierce fires","That glowd furious in the expanse","I Then Light first began from the fires","Beams conducted by fluid so pure","Flowd around the Immense Los beheld","Forthwith writhing upon the dark void","The Back bone of Urizen appear","Hurtling upon the wind","Like a serpent like an iron chain","Whirling about in the Deep","Upfolding his Fibres together","To a Form of impregnable strength","Los astonishd and terrified built","Furnaces he formed an Anvil","A Hammer of adamant then began","The binding of Urizen day and night","Circling round the dark Demon with howlings","Dismay and sharp blightings the Prophet","Of Eternity beat on his iron links","And first from those infinite fires","The light that flowd down on the winds","lie siezd beating incessant condensing","The subtil particles in an Orb","Roaring indignant the bright sparks","Endurd the vast Hammer but unwearied","Los beat on the Anvil till glorious","An immense Orb of fire be framd","Oft he quenchd it beneath in the Deeps","Then surveyd the all bright mass Again","Siezing fires from the terrific Orbs","He heated the round Globe then beat","While roaring his Furnaces endurd","The chaind Orb in their infinite wombs","Nine ages completed their circles","When Los heated the glowing mass casting","It down into the Deeps the Deeps fled","Away in redounding smoke the Sun","Stood selfbalancd And Los smild with joy","He the vast Spine of Urizen siezd","And bound down to the glowing illusion","But no light for the Deep fled away","On all sides and left an unformd","Dark vacuity here Urizen lay","In fierce torments oil his glowing bed","Till his Brain in a rock and his Heart","In a fleshy slough formed four rivers","Obscuring the immense Orb of fire","Flowing down into night till a Form","Was completed a Human Illusion","In darkness and deep clouds involvd"];

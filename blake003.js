BLAKE003 = ["Or Love in a golden bowl","All but the youngest she in paleness sought the secret air","To fade away like morning beauty from her mortal day","Down by the river of Adona her soft voice is heard","And thus her gentle lamentation falls like morning dew","O life of this our spring why fades the lotus of the water","Why fade these children of the spring born but to smile fall","Ah Thel is like a watry bow and like a parting cloud","Like a reflection in a glass like shadows in the water","Like dreams of infants like a smile upon an infants face","Like the doves voice like transient day like music in the air","Ah gentle may I lay me down and gentle rest my head","And gentle sleep the sleep of death and gentle hear the voice","Of him that walketh in the garden in the evening time","The Lilly of the valley breathing in the humble grass","Answer d the lovely maid and said I am a watry weed","And I am very small and love to dwell in lowly vales","So weak the gilded butterfly scarce perches on my head","Yet I am visited from heaven and he that smiles on all","Walks in the valley and each morn over me spreads his hand","Saying rejoice thou humble grass thou newborn lilly flower","Thou gentle maid of silent valleys and of modest brooks","For thou shalt be clothed in light and fed with morning manna","Till summers heat melts thee beside the fountains and the springs","To flourish in eternal vales then why should Thel complain","Why should the mistress of the vales of Har utter a sigh","She ceasd smild in tears then sat down in her silver shrine","Thel answerd O thou little virgin of the peaceful valley","Giving to those that cannot crave the voiceless the o ertired","Thy breath doth nourish the innocent lamb he smells thy milky garments","He crops thy flowers while thou sittest smiling in his face","Wiping his mild and meekin mouth from all contagious taints","Thy wine doth purify the golden honey thy perfume","Which thou dost scatter on every little blade of grass that springs","Revives the milked cow tames the firebreathing steed","But Thel is like a faint cloud kindled at the rising sun","I vanish from my pearly throne and who shall find my place","Queen of the vales the Lilly answerd ask the tender cloud","And it shall tell thee why it glitters in the morning sky","And why it scatters its bright beauty thro the humid air","Descend O little cloud hover before the eyes of Thel","The Cloud descended and the Lilly bowd her modest head","And went to mind her numerous charge among the verdant grass","O little Cloud the virgin said I charge thee tell to me","Why thou complainest not when in one hour thou fade away","Then we shall seek thee but not find ah Thel is like to thee","I pass away yet I complain and no one hears my voice","The Cloud then shew d his golden bead his bright form emerg d","Hovering and glittering on the air before the face of Thel","O virgin know st thou not our steeds drink of the golden springs","Where Luvah doth renew his horses look st thou on my youth","And fearest thou because I vanish and am seen no more","Nothing remains O maid I tell thee when I pass away","It is to tenfold life to love to peace and raptures holy","Unseen descending weigh my light wings upon balmy flowers","And court the fair eyed dew to take me to her shining tent","The weeping virgin trembling kneels before the risen sun","Till we arise link d in a golden band and never part","But walk united bearing food to all our tender flowers","Dost thou O little Cloud I fear that I am not like thee","For I walk through the vales of Har and smell the sweetest flowers","But I feed not the little flowers I hear the warbling birds","But I feed not the warbling birds they fly and seek their food","But Thel delights in these no more because I fade away","And all shall say without a use this shining woman liv d","Or did she only live to be at death the food of worms","The Cloud reclind upon his airy throne and answer d thus","Then if thou art the food of worms O virgin of the skies","How great thy use how great thy blessing every thing that lives","Lives not alone nor for itself fear not and I will call","The weak worm from its lowly bed and thou shalt hear its voice","Come forth worm of the silent valley to thy pensive queen","The helpless worm arose and sat upon the Lillys leaf","And the bright Cloud saild on to find his partner in the vale","Then Thel astonish d view d the Worm upon its dewy bed","Art thou a Worm image of weakness art thou but a Worm","I see thee like an infant wrapped in the Lillys leaf","Ah weep not little voice thou can st not speak but thou can st weep","Is this a Worm I see thee lay helpless naked weeping","And none to answer none to cherish thee with mothers smiles","The Clod of Clay heard the Worms voice raisd her pitying head","She bowd over the weeping infant and her life exhal d","In milky fondness then on Thel she fix d her humble eyes","O beauty of the vales of Har we live not for ourselves","Thou seest me the meanest thing and so I am indeed","My bosom of itself is cold and of itself is dark","But he that loves the lowly pours his oil upon my head","And kisses me and binds his nuptial bands around my breast","And says Thou mother of my children I have loved thee","And I have given thee a crown that none can take away","But how this is sweet maid I know not and I cannot know","I ponder and I cannot ponder yet I live and love","The daughter of beauty wip d her pitying tears with her white veil","And said Alas I knew not this and therefore did I weep","That God would love a Worm I knew and punish the evil foot","That wilful bruis d its helpless form but that he cherish d it","With milk and oil I never knew and therefore did I weep","And I complaind in the mild air because I fade away","And lay me down in thy cold bed and leave my shining lot","Queen of the vales the matron Clay answerd I heard thy sighs","And all thy moans flew o er my roof but I have call d them down","Wilt thou O Queen enter my house tis given thee to enter","And to return fear nothing enter with thy virgin feet","The eternal gates terrific porter lifted the northern bar","Thel enter d in saw the secrets of the land unknown","She saw the couches of the dead where the fibrous roots","Of every heart on earth infixes deep its restless twists","A land of sorrows of tears where never smile was seen","She wanderd in the land of clouds thro valleys dark listning","Dolours lamentations waiting oft beside a dewy grave","She stood in silence listning to the voices of the ground","Till to her own grave plot she came there she sat down","And heard this voice of sorrow breathed from the hollow pit","Why cannot the Ear be closed to its own destruction","Or the glistning Eye to the poison of a smile","Why are Eyelids stord with arrows ready drawn","Where a thousand fighting men in ambush lie","Or an Eye of gifts graces show ring fruits coined gold","Why a Tongue impress d with honey from every wind","Why an Ear a whirlpool fierce to draw creations in","Why a Nostril wide inhaling terror trembling affright","Why a tender curb upon the youthful burning boy","Why a little curtain of flesh on the bed of our desire","The Virgin started from her seat with a shriek","Fled back unhinderd till she came into the vales of Har","In seed time learn in harvest teach in winter enjoy","Drive your cart and your plow over the bones of the dead","The road of excess leads to the palace of wisdom","Prudence is a rich ugly old maid courted by Incapacity","He who desires but acts not breeds pestilence","The cut worm forgives the plow","Dip him in the river who loves water","A fool sees not the same tree that a wise man sees","He whose face gives no light shall never become a star","Eternity is in love with the productions of time","The busy bee has no time for sorrow","The hours of folly are measur d by the clock but of wisdom no clock can measure","All wholsom food is caught without a net or a trap","Bring out number weight and measure in a year of dearth","No bird soars too high if he soars with his own wings","A dead body revenges not injuries","The most sublime act is to set another before you","If the fool would persist in his folly he would become wise","Folly is the cloke of knavery","Shame is Prides cloke","Prisons are built with stones of Law Brothels with bricks of Religion","The pride of the peacock is the glory of God","The lust of the goat is the bounty of God","The wrath of the lion is the wisdom of God","The nakedness of woman is the work of God","Excess of sorrow laughs Excess of joy weeps","The roaring of lions the howling of wolves","the raging of the stormy sea and the destructive sword","are portions of eternity too great for the eye of man","The fox condemns the trap not himself","Joys impregnate Sorrows bring forth","Let man wear the fell of the lion woman the fleece of the sheep","The bird a nest the spider a web man friendship","The selfish smiling fool and the sullen frowning fool","shall be both thought wise that they may be a rod","What is now proved was once only imagin d","The rat the mouse the fox the rabbet watch the roots","the lion the tyger the horse the elephant watch the fruits","The cistern contains the fountain overflows","One thought fills immensity","Always be ready to speak your mind and a base man will avoid you","Every thing possible to be believ d is an image of truth","The eagle never lost so much time as when he submitted to learn of the crow","The fox provides for himself but God provides for the lion","Think in the morning Act in the noon Eat in the evening Sleep in the night","He who has sufferd you to impose on him knows you","As the plow follows words so God rewards prayers","The tygers of wrath are wiser than the horses of instruction","Expect poison from the standing water","You never know what is enough unless you know what is more than enough","Listen to the fools reproach it is a kingly title","The eyes of fire the nostrils of air the mouth of water the beard of earth","The weak in courage is strong in cunning","The apple tree never asks the beech how he shall grow","nor the lion the horse how he shall take his prey","The thankful reciever bears a plentiful harvest","If others bad not been foolish we should be so","The soul of sweet delight can never be defil d","When thou seest an Eagle thou seest a portion of Genius lift up thy head","As the catterpiller chooses the fairest leaves to lay her eggs on","so the priest lays his curse on the fairest joys","To create a little flower is the labour of ages","Damn braces Bless relaxes","The best wine is the oldest the best water the newest","Prayers plow not Praises reap not","Joys laugh not Sorrows weep not","The head Sublime the heart Pathos the genitals Beauty the hands and feet Proportion","As the air to a bird or the sea to a fish so is contempt to the contemptible","The crow wish d every thing was black the owl that every thing was white","If the lion was advised by the fox he would be cunning","Improvement makes strait roads but the crooked roads","without Improvement are roads of Genius","Sooner murder an infant in its cradle than nurse unacted desires","Where man is not nature is barren","Truth can never be told so as to be understood and not be believ d","Enough or Too much","Five windows light the cavern d Man thro one he breathes the air","Thro one hears music of the spheres thro one the eternal vine","Flourishes that he may recieve the grapes thro one can look","And see small portions of the eternal world that ever groweth","Thro one himself pass out what time he please but he will not","For stolen joys are sweet and bread eaten in secret pleasant","So sang a Fairy mocking as he sat on a streak d Tulip","Thinking none saw him when he ceas d I started from the trees","And caught him in my hat as boys knock down a butterfly","How know you this said I small Sir where did you learn this song","Seeing himself in my possession thus he answered me","My master I am yours command me for I must obey","Then tell me what is the material world and is it dead","He laughing answer d I will write a book on leaves of flowers","If you will feed me on lovethoughts and give me now and then","A cup of sparkling poetic fancies so when I am tipsie","I ll sing to you to this soft lute and shew you all alive","The world when every particle of dust breathes forth its joy","I took him home in my warm bosom as we went along","Wild flowers I gatherd and he shew d me each eternal flower","He laugh d aloud to see them whimper because they were pluck d","They hover d round me like a cloud of incense when I came","Into my parlour and sat down and took my pen to write","My Fairy sat upon the table and dictated EUROPE","The nameless shadowy female rose from out the breast of Orc","Her snaky hair brandishing in the winds of Enitharmon","And thus her voice arose","O mother Enitharmon wilt thou bring forth other sons","To cause my name to vanish that my place may not be found","For I am faint with travel t","Like the dark cloud disburdend in the day of dismal thunder","My roots are brandish d in the heavens my fruits in earth beneath","Surge foam and labour into life first born and first consum d","Consumed and consuming","Then why shouldst thou accursed mother bring me into life","I wrap my turban of thick clouds around my lab ring head","And fold the sheety waters as a mantle round my limbs","Yet the red sun and moon","And all the overflowing stars rain down prolific pains","Unwilling I look up to heaven unwilling count the stars","Sitting in fathomless abyss of my immortal shrine","I sieze their burning power","And bring forth howling terrors all devouring fiery kings","Devouring and devoured roaming on dark and desolate mountains","In forests of eternal death shrieking in hollow trees","Ah mother Enitharmon","Stamp not with solid form this vig rous progeny of fires","I bring forth from my teeming bosom myriads of flames","And thou dost stamp them with a signet then they roam abroad","And leave me void as death","Ah I am drown d in shady woe and visionary joy","And who shall bind the infinite with an eternal band","To compass it with swaddling bands and who shall cherish it","With milk and honey","I see it smile and I roll inward and my voice is past","She ceast and rolld her shady clouds","Into the secret place","The deep of winter came","What time the secret child","Descended thro the orient gates of the eternal day","War ceas d and all the troops like shadows fled to their abodes","Then Enitharmon saw her sons and daughters rise around","Like pearly clouds they meet together in the crystal house","And Los possessor of the moon joy d in the peaceful night","Thus speaking while his num rous sons shook their bright fiery wings","Again the night is come t","That strong Urthona takes his rest","And Urizen unloos d from chains","Glows like a meteor in the distant north","Stretch forth your hands and strike the elemental strings","Awake the thunders of the deep","The shrill winds wake","Till all the sons of Urizen look out and envy Los","Sieze all the spirits of life and bind","Their warbling joys to our loud strings","Bind all the nourishing sweets of earth","To give us bliss that we may drink the sparkling wine of Los","And let us laugh at war","Despising toil and care","Because the days and nights of joy in lucky hours renew","Arise O Orc from thy deep den","First born of Enitharmon rise","And we will crown thy head with garlands of the ruddy vine","For now thou art bound","And I may see thee in the hour of bliss my eldest born","The horrent Demon rose surrounded with red stars of fire","Whirling about in furious circles round the immortal fiend","Then Enitharmon down descended into his red light","And thus her voice rose to her children the distant heavens reply","Now comes the night of Enitharmons joy","Who shall I call Who shall I send","That Woman lovely Woman may have dominion","Arise O Rintrah thee I call and Palamabron thee","Go tell the human race that Womans love is Sin","That an Eternal life awaits the worms of sixty winters","In an allegorical abode where existence hath never come","Forbid all joy and from her childhood shall the little female","Spread nets in every secret path","My weary eyelids draw towards the evening my bliss is yet but new","Arise O Rintrah eldest born second to none but Orc","O lion Rintrah raise thy fury from thy forests black","Bring Palamabron horned priest skipping upon the mountains","And silent Elynittria the silver bowed queen","Rintrah where hast thou hid thy bride","Weeps she in desart shades","Alas my Rintrah bring the lovely jealous Ocalythron","Arise my son bring all thy brethren O thou king of fire","Prince of the sun I see thee with thy innumerable race","Thick as the summer stars","But each ramping his golden mane shakes","And thine eyes rejoice because of strength O Rintrah furious king","Enitharmon slept","Eighteen hundred years Man was a Dream","The night of Nature and their harps unstrung","She slept in middle of her nightly song","Eighteen hundred years a female dream","Shadows of men in fleeting bands upon the winds t","Divide the heavens of Europe","Till Albions Angel smitten with his own plagues fled with his bands","The cloud bears hard on Albions shore","Fill d with immortal demons of futurity","In council gather the smitten Angels of Albion","The cloud bears hard upon the council house down rushing","On the heads of Albions Angels","One hour they lay buried beneath the ruins of that hall","But as the stars rise from the salt lake they arise in pain","In troubled mists o erclouded by the terrors of strugling times","In thoughts perturb d they rose from the bright ruins silent following","The fiery King who sought his ancient temple serpentform d","That stretches out its shady length along the Island white","Round him roll d his clouds of war silent the Angel went","Along the infinite shores of Thames to golden Verulam","There stand the venerable porches that hightowering rear","Their oaksurrounded pillars form d of massy stones uncut","With tool stones precious such eternal in the heavens","Of colours twelve few known on earth give light in the opake","Plac d in the order of the stars when the five senses whelm d","In deluge o er the earthborn man then turn d the fluxile eyes","Into two stationary orbs concentrating all things","The evervarying spiral ascents to the heavens of heavens","Were bended downward and the nostrils golden gates shut","Turn d outward barr d and petrify d against the infinite","Thought chang d the infinite to a serpent that which pitieth","To a devouring flame and man fled from its face and hid","In forests of night then all the eternal forests were divided","Into earths rolling in circles of space that like an ocean rush d","And overwhelmed all except this finite wall of flesh","Then was the serpent temple form d image of infinite","Shut up in finite revolutions and man became an Angel","Heaven a mighty circle turning God a tyrant crown d","Now arriv d the ancient Guardian at the southern porch","That planted thick with trees of blackest leaf and in a vale","Obscure inclos d the Stone of Night oblique it stood o erhung","With purple flowers and berries red image of that sweet south","Once open to the heavens and elevated on the human neck","Now overgrown with hair and coverd with a stony roof","Downward tis sunk beneath th attractive north that round the feet","A raging whirlpool draws the dizzy enquirer to his grave","Albions Angel rose upon the Stone of Night","He saw Urizen on the Atlantic","And his brazen Book","That Kings and Priests had copied on Earth","Expanded from North to South","And the clouds and fires pale rolld round in the night of Enitharmon","Round Albions cliffs and Londons walls still Enitharmon slept","Rolling volumes of grey mist involve Churches Palaces Towers","For Urizen unclaspd his Book feeding his soul with pity","The youth of England hid in gloom curse the paind heavens compell d","Into the deadly night to see the form of Albions Angel","Their parents brought them forth and aged ignorance preaches canting","On a vast rock perciev d by those senses that are clos d from thought","Bleak dark abrupt it stands and overshadows London city","They saw his boney feet on the rock the flesh consum d in flames","They saw the Serpent temple lifted above shadowing the Island white","They heard the voice of Albions Angel howling in flames of Orc","Seeking the trump of the last doom","Above the rest the howl was heard from Westminster louder and louder","The Guardian of the secret codes forsook his ancient mansion","Driven out by the flames of Orc his furr d robes and false locks","Adhered and grew one with his flesh and nerves and veins shot thro them","With dismal torment sick hanging upon the wind he fled","Groveling along Great George Street thro the Park gate all the soldiers","Fled from his sight he drag d his torments to the wilderness","Thus was the howl thro Europe","For Orc rejoic d to hear the howling shadows","But Palamabron shot his lightnings trenching down his wide back","And Rintrah hung with all his legions in the nether deep","Enitharmon laugh d in her sleep to see O womans triumph","Every house a den every man bound the shadows are filld","With spectres and the windows wove over with curses of iron","Over the doors Thou shalt not and over the chimneys Fear is written","With bands of iron round their necks fasten d into the walls","The citizens in leaden gyves the inhabitants of suburbs","Walk heavy soft and bent are the bones of villagers","Between the clouds of Urizen the flames of Orc roll heavy","Around the limbs of Albions Guardian his flesh consuming","Howlings and hissings shrieks and groans and voices of despair","Arise around him in the cloudy","Heavens of Albion Furious","The red limb d Angel siez d in horror and torment","The Trump of the last doom but he could not blow the iron tube","Thrice he assay d presumptuous to awake the dead to Judgment","A mighty Spirit leap d from the land of Albion","Nam d Newton he siez d the Trump and blow d the enormous blast","Yellow as leaves of Autumn the myriads of Angelic hosts","I will sing you a song of Los the Eternal Prophet","He sung it to four harps at the tables of Eternity","In heartformed Africa","Urizen faded Ariston shudderd","And thus the Song began","Adam stood in the garden of Eden","And Noah on the mountains of Ararat","They saw Urizen give his Laws to the Nations","By the hands of the children of Los","Adam shudderd Noah faded black grew the sunny African","When Rintrah gave Abstract Philosophy to Brama in the East","Night spoke to the Cloud","Lo these Human form d spirits in smiling hipocrisy War","Against one another so let them War on slaves to the eternal Elements","Noah shrunk beneath the waters","Abram fled in fires from Chaldea","Moses beheld upon Mount Sinai forms of dark delusion","To Trismegistus Palamabron gave an abstract Law","To Pythagoras Socrates and Plato","Times rolled on o er all the sons of Har time after time","Orc on Mount Atlas howld chain d down with the Chain of Jealousy","Then Oothoon hoverd over Judah and Jerusalem","And Jesus heard her voice a man of sorrows he recievd","A Gospel from wretched Theotormon","The human race began to wither for the healthy built","Secluded places fearing the joys of Love","And the disease d only propagated","So Antamon call d up Leutha from her valleys of delight","And to Mahomet a loose Bible gave","But in the North to Odin Sotha gave a Code of War","Because of Diralada thinking to reclaim his joy","These were the Churches Hospitals Castles Palaces","Like nets and gins and traps to catch the joys of Eternity And all the rest a desart","Till like a dream Eternity was obliterated and erased","Since that dread day when Har and Heva fled","Because their brethren and sisters liv d in War and Lust","And as they fled they shrunk","Into two narrow doleful forms","Creeping in reptile flesh upon","The bosom of the ground","And all the vast of Nature shrunk","Before their shrunken eyes","Thus the terrible race of Los and Enitharmon gave","Laws and Religions to the sons of Har binding them more","And more to Earth closing and restraining","Till a Philosophy of Five Senses was complete","Urizen wept and gave it into the hands of Newton and Locke","Clouds roll heavy upon the Alps round Rousseau and Voltaire","And on the mountains of Lebanon round the deceased Gods","Of Asia and on the desarts of Africa round the Fallen Angels","The Guardian Prince of Albion burns in his nightly tent","The Kings of Asia heard","The howl rise up from Europe","And each ran out from his Web","From his ancient woven Den","For the darkness of Asia was startled","At the thickflaming thoughtcreating fires of Orc","And the Kings of Asia stood","And cried in bitterness of soul","Shall not the King call for Famine from the heath","Nor the Priest for Pestilence from the fen","To restrain to dismay to thin","The inhabitants of mountain and plain","In the day of fullfeeding prosperity","And the night of delicious songs","Shall not the Councellor throw his curb","Of Poverty on the laborious","To fix the price of labour","To invent allegoric riches","And the privy admonishers of men","Call for fires in the City","For heaps of smoking ruins","In the night of prosperity and wantonness","To turn man from his path","To restrain the child from the womb","To cut off the bread from the city","That the remnant may learn to obey","That the pride of the heart may fail","That the lust of the eyes may be quench d","That the delicate ear in its infancy","May be dull d and the nostrils clos d up","To teach mortal worms the path","That leads from the gates of the Grave","Urizen heard them cry","And his shudd ring waving wings","Went enormous above the red flames","Drawing clouds of despair thro the heavens","Of Europe as he went","And his Books of brass iron and gold","Melted over the land as he flew","Heavywaving howling weeping","And he stood over Judea","And stay d in his ancient place","And stretch d his clouds over Jerusalem","For Adam a mouldering skeleton","Lay bleach d on the garden of Eden","And Noah as white as snow","On the mountains of Ararat","Then the thunders of Urizen bellow d aloud","From his woven darkness above","Orc raging in European darkness","Arose like a pillar of fire above the Alps","Like a serpent of fiery flame","The sullen Earth","Shrunk","Forth from the dead dust rattling bones to bones","Join shaking convuls d the shivring clay breathes","And all flesh naked stands Fathers and Friends","Mothers and Infants Kings and Warriors","The Grave shrieks with delight and shakes","Her hollow womb and clasps the solid stem","Her bosom swells with wild desire","And milk and blood and glandous wine","In rivers rush and shout and dance","On mountain dale and plain","The SONG of LOS is Ended Urizen Wept"];

BLAKE006 = ["Of the primeval Priests assumd power","When Eternals spurnd back his religion","And gave him a place in the north","Obscure shadowy void solitary","Eternals I hear your call gladly","Dictate swift winged words fear not","To unfold your dark visions of torment","Lo a shadow of horror is risen","In Eternity Unknown unprolific","Self closd all repelling what Demon","Hath formd this abominable void","This soul shuddring vacuum Some said","It is Urizen But unknown abstracted","Brooding secret the dark power hid","Times on times he divided measurd","Space by space in his ninefold darkness","Unseen unknown changes appeard","In his desolate mountains rifted furious","By the black winds of perturbation","For he strove in battles dire","In unseen conflictions with shapes","Bred from his forsaken wilderness","Of beast bird fish serpent element","Combustion blast vapour and cloud","Dark revolving in silent activity","Unseen in tormenting passions","An activity unknown and horrible","A self contemplating shadow","In enormous labours occupied","But Eternals beheld his vast forests","Age on ages he lay closd unknown","Brooding shut in the deep all avoid","The petrific abominable chaos","His cold horrors silent dark Urizen","Prepard his ten thousands of thunders","Rangd in gloomd array stretch out across","The dread world the rolling of wheels","As of swelling seas sound in his clouds","In his hills of stord snows in his mountains","Of hail ice voices of terror","Are heard like thunders of autumn","When the cloud blazes over the harvests","Earth was not nor globes of attraction","The will of the Immortal expanded","Or contracted his all flexible senses","Death was not but eternal life sprung","The sound of a trumpet the heavens","Awoke vast clouds of blood rolld","Round the dim rocks of Urizen so namd","That solitary one in Immensity","Shrill the trumpet myriads of Eternity","Muster around the bleak desarts","Now filld with clouds darkness waters","That rolld perplexd labring utterd","Words articulate bursting in thunders","That rolld on the tops of his mountains","From the depths of dark solitude From","The eternal abode in my holiness","Hidden set apart in my stern counsels","Reservd for the days of futurity","I have sought for a joy without pain","For a solid without fluctuation","Why will you die O Eternals","Why live in unquenchable burnings","First I fought with the fire consumd","Inwards into a deep world within","A void immense wild dark deep","Where nothing was Natures wide womb","And self balancd stretchd oer the void","I alone even I the winds merciless","Bound but condensing in torrents","They fall fall strong I repelld","The vast waves arose on the waters","A wide world of solid obstruction","Here alone I in books formd of metals","Have written the secrets of wisdom","The secrets of dark contemplation","By fightings and conflicts dire","With terrible monsters Sinbred","Which the bosoms of all inhabit","Seven deadly Sins of the soul","Lo I unfold my darkness and on","This rock place with strong hand the Book","Of eternal brass written in my solitude","Laws of peace of love of unity","Of pity compassion forgiveness","Let each chuse one habitation","His ancient infinite mansion","One command one joy one desire","One curse one weight one measure","One King one God one Law","The voice ended they saw his pale visage","Emerge from the darkness his hand","On the rock of eternity unclasping","The Book of brass Rage siezd the strong","Rage fury intense indignation","In cataracts of fire blood gall","In whirlwinds of sulphurous smoke","And enormous forms of energy","All the seven deadly sins of the soul","In living creations appeard","In the flames of eternal fury","Sundring darkning thundring","Rent away with a terrible crash","Eternity rolld wide apart","Wide asunder rolling","Mountainous all around","Departing departing departing","Leaving ruinous fragments of life","Hanging frowning cliffs all between","An ocean of voidness unfathomable","The roaring fires ran oer the heavns","In whirlwinds cataracts of blood","And oer the dark desarts of Urizen","Fires pour thro the void on all sides","On Urizens selfbegotten armies","But no light from the fires all was darkness","In the flames of Eternal fury","In fierce anguish quenchless flames","To the desarts and rocks He ran raging","To hide but He could not combining","He dug mountains hills in vast strength","He piled them in incessant labour","In howlings pangs fierce madness","Long periods in burning fires labouring","Till hoary and agebroke and aged","In despair and the shadows of death","And a roof vast petrific around","On all sides He framd like a womb","Where thousands of rivers in veins","Of blood pour down the mountains to cool","The eternal fires beating without","From Eternals like a black globe","Viewd by sons of Eternity standing","On the shore of the infinite ocean","Like a human heart strugling beating","The vast world of Urizen appeard","And Los round the dark globe of Urizen","Kept watch for Eternals to confine","The obscure separation alone","For Eternity stood wide apart","As the stars are apart from the earth","Los wept howling around the dark Demon","And cursing his lot for in anguish","Urizen was rent from his side","And a fathomless void for his feet","And intense fires for his dwelling","But Urizen laid in a stony sleep","Unorganizd rent from Eternity","The Eternals said What is this Death","Urizen is a clod of clay","Los howld in a dismal stupor","Groaning gnashing groaning","Till the wrenching apart was healed","But the wrenching of Urizen heald not","Cold featureless flesh or clay","Rifted with direful changes","He lay in a dreamless night","Till Los rouzd his fires affrighted","At the formless unmeasurable death","Los smitten with astonishment","Frightend at the hurtling bones","And at the surging sulphureous","Perturbed Immortal mad raging","In whirlwinds pitch nitre","Round the furious limbs of Los","And Los formed nets gins","And threw the nets round about","He watchd in shuddring fear","The dark changes bound every change","With rivets of iron brass","And these were the changes of Urizen","Ages on ages rolld over him","In stony sleep ages rolld over him","Like a dark waste stretching changable","By earthquakes rivn belching sullen fires","On ages rolld ages in ghastly","Sick torment around him in whirlwinds","Of darkness the eternal Prophet howld","Beating still on his rivets of iron","Pouring sodor of iron dividing","The horrible night into watches","And Urizen so his eternal name","His prolific delight obscurd more more","In dark secresy hiding in surgeing","Sulphureous fluid his phantasies","The Eternal Prophet heavd the dark bellows","And turnd restless the tongs and the hammer","Incessant beat forging chains new new","Numbring with links hours days years","The eternal mind bounded began to roll","Eddies of wrath ceaseless round round","And the sulphureous foam surgeing thick","Settled a lake bright shining clear","White as the snow on the mountains cold","Forgetfulness dumbness necessity","In chains of the mind locked up","Like fetters of ice shrinking together","Disorganizd rent from Eternity","Los beat on his fetters of iron","And heated his furnaces pourd","Iron sodor and sodor of brass","Restless turnd the immortal inchaind","Heaving dolorous anguishd unbearable","Till a roof shaggy wild inclosd","In an orb his fountain of thought","In a horrible dreamful slumber","Like the linked infernal chain","A vast Spine writhd in torment","Upon the winds shooting paind","Ribs like a bending cavern","And bones of solidness froze","Over all his nerves of joy","And a first Age passed over","And a state of dismal woe","From the caverns of his jointed Spine","Down sunk with fright a red","Round globe hot burning deep","Deep down into the Abyss","Panting Conglobing Trembling","Shooting out ten thousand branches","Around his solid bones","And a second Age passed over","And a state of dismal woe","In harrowing fear rolling round","His nervous brain shot branches","Round the branches of his heart","On high into two little orbs","And fixed in two little eaves","Hiding carefully from the wind","His Eyes beheld the deep","And a third Age passed over","And a state of dismal woe","The pangs of hope began","In heavy pain striving struggling","Two Ears in close volutions","From beneath his orbs of vision","Shot spiring out and petrified","As they grew And a fourth Age passed","And a state of dismal woe","In ghastly torment sick","Hanging upon the wind","Two Nostrils bent down to the deep","And a fifth Age passed over","And a state of dismal woe","In ghastly torment sick","Within his ribs bloated round","A craving Hungry Cavern","Thence arose his channeld Throat","And like a red flame a Tongue","Of thirst of hunger appeard","And a sixth Age passed over","And a state of dismal woe","Enraged stifled with torment","He threw his right Arm to the north","His left Arm to the south","Shooting out in anguish deep","And his Feet stampd the nether Abyss","In trembling howling dismay","And a seventh Age passed over","And a state of dismal woe","I In terrors Los shrunk from his task","His great hammer fell from his hand","His fires beheld and sickening","Hid their strong limbs in smoke","For with noises ruinous loud","With hurtlings clashings groans","The Immortal endurd his chains","Tho bound in a deadly sleep","All the myriads of Eternity","All the wisdom joy of life","Roll like a sea around him","Except what his little orbs","Of sight by degrees unfold","And now his eternal life","Like a dream was obliterated","Shuddring the Eternal Prophet smote","With a stroke from his north to south region","The bellows hammer are silent now","A nerveless silence his prophetic voice","Siezd a cold solitude dark void","The Eternal Prophet Urizen closd","Ages on ages rolld over them","Cut off from life light frozen","Into horrible forms of deformity","Los sufferd his fires to decay","Then he lookd back with anxious desire","But the space undivided by existence","Struck horror into his soul","Los wept obscurd with mourning","His bosom earthquakd with sighs","He saw Urizen deadly black","In his chains bound Pity began","In anguish dividing dividing","For pity divides the soul","In pangs eternity on eternity","Life in cataracts pourd down his cliffs","The void shrunk the lymph into Nerves","Wandring wide on the bosom of night","And left a round globe of blood","Trembling upon the Void","Thus the Eternal Prophet was divided","Before the deathimage of Urizen","For in changeable clouds and darkness","In a winterly night beneath","The Abyss of Los stretchd immense","And now seen now obscurd to the eyes","Of Eternals the visions remote","Of the dark seperation appeard","As glasses discover Worlds","In the endless Abyss of space","So the expanding eyes of Immortals","Beheld the dark visions of Los","And the globe of life blood trembling","The globe of life blood trembled","Branching out into roots","Fibrous writhing upon the winds","Fibres of blood milk and tears","In pangs eternity on eternity","At length in tears cries imbodied","A female form trembling and pale","Waves before his deathy face","All Eternity shudderd at sight","Of the first female now separate","Pale as a cloud of snow","Waving before the face of Los","Wonder awe fear astonishment","Petrify the eternal myriads","At the first female form now separate","They calld her Pity and fled","Spread a Tent with strong curtains around them","Let cords stakes bind in the Void","That Eternals may no more behold them","They began to weave curtains of darkness","They erected large pillars round the Void","With golden hooks fastend in the pillars","With infinite labour the Eternals","A woof wove and called it Science","But Los saw the Female pitied","He embracd her she wept she refusd","In perverse and cruel delight","She fled from his arms yet he followd","Eternity shudderd when they saw","Man begetting his likeness","On his own divided image","A time passed over the Eternals","Began to erect the tent","When Enitharmon sick","Felt a Worm within her womb","Yet helpless it lay like a Worm","In the trembling womb","To be moulded into existence","All day the worm lay on her bosom","All night within her womb","The worm lay till it grew to a serpent","With dolorous hissings poisons","Round Enitharmons loins folding","Coild within Enitharmons womb","The serpent grew casting its scales","With sharp pangs the hissings began","To change to a grating cry","Many sorrows and dismal throes","Many forms of fish bird beast","Brought forth an Infant form","Where was a worm before","The Eternals their tent finished","Alarmd with these gloomy visions","When Enitharmon groaning","Producd a man Child to the light","A shriek ran thro Eternity","And a paralytic stroke","At the birth of the Human shadow","Delving earth in his resistless way","Howling the Child with fierce flames","Issud from Enitharmon","The Eternals closed the tent","They beat down the stakes the cords","Stretchd for a work of eternity","No more Los beheld Eternity","In his hands he siezd the infant","He bathed him in springs of sorrow","He gave him to Enitharmon","They named the child Orc he grew","Fed with milk of Enitharmon","Los awoke her O sorrow pain","A tightning girdle grew","Around his bosom In sobbings","He burst the girdle in twain","But still another girdle","Opressd his bosom In sobbings","Again he burst it Again","Another girdle succeeds","The girdle was formd by day","By night was burst in twain","These falling down on the rock","Into an iron Chain","In each other link by link lockd","They took Orc to the top of a mountain","O how Enitharmon wept","They chaind his young limbs to the rock","With the Chain of Jealousy","Beneath Urizens deathful shadow","The dead heard the voice of the child","And began to awake from sleep","All things heard the voice of the child","And began to awake to life","And Urizen craving with hunger","Stung with the odours of Nature","Explord his dens around","He formd a line a plummet","To divide the Abyss beneath","He formd a dividing rule","He formed scales to weigh","He formed massy weights","He formed a brazen quadrant","He formed golden compasses","And began to explore the Abyss","And he planted a garden of fruits","But Los encircled Enitharmon","With fires of Prophecy","From the sight of Urizen Orc","And she bore an enormous race","Urizen explord his dens","Mountain moor wilderness","With a globe of fire lighting his journey","A fearful journey annoyd","By cruel enormities forms","Of life on his forsaken mountains","And his world teemd vast enormities","Frightning faithless fawning","Portions of life similitudes","Of a foot or a hand or a head","Or a heart or an eye they swam mischevous","Dread terrors delighting in blood","Most Urizen sickend to see","His eternal creations appear","Sons daughters of sorrow on mountains","Weeping wailing first Thiriel appeard","Astonishd at his own existence","Like a man from a cloud born Utha","From the waters emerging laments","Grodna rent the deep earth howling","Amazd his heavens immense cracks","Like the ground parchd with heat then Fuzon","Flamd out first begotten last born","All his eternal sons in like manner","His daughters from green herbs cattle","From monsters worms of the pit","He in darkness closd viewd all his race","And his soul sickend he cursd","Both sons daughters for he saw","That no flesh nor spirit could keep","His iron laws one moment","For he saw that life livd upon death","The Ox in the slaughter house moans","The Dog at the wintry door","And he wept he called it Pity","And his tears flowed down on the winds","Cold he wanderd on high over their cities","In weeping pain woe","And whereever he wanderd in sorrows","Upon the aged heavens","A cold shadow followd behind him","Like a spiders web moist cold dim","Drawing out from his sorrowing soul","The dungeonlike heaven dividing","Where ever the footsteps of Urizen","Walkd over the cities in sorrow","Till a Web dark cold throughout all","The tormented element stretchd","From the sorrows of Urizens soul","And the Web is a Female in embrio","None could break the Web no wings of fire","So twisted the cords so knotted","The meshes twisted like to the human brain","And all calld it The Net of Religion","Then the Inhabitants of those Cities","Felt their Nerves change into Marrow","And hardening Bones began","In swift diseases and torments","In throbbings shootings grindings","Thro all the coasts till weakend","The Senses inward rushd shrinking","Beneath the dark net of infection","Till the shrunken eyes clouded over","Discernd not the woven hipocrisy","But the streaky slime in their heavens","Brought together by narrowing perceptions","Appeard transparent air for their eyes","Grew small like the eyes of a man","And in reptile forms shrinking together","Of seven feet stature they remaind","Six days they shrunk up from existence","And on the seventh day they rested","And they blessd the seventh day in sick hope","And forgot their eternal life","And their thirty cities divided","In form of a human heart","No more could they rise at will","In the infinite void but bound down","To earth by their narrowing perceptions","They lived a period of years","Then left a noisom body","To the jaws of devouring darkness","And their children wept built","Tombs in the desolate places","And formd laws of prudence and calld them","The eternal laws of God","And the thirty cities remaind","Surrounded by salt floods now calld","Africa its name was then Egypt","The remaining sons of Urizen","Beheld their brethren shrink together","Beneath the Net of Urizen","Perswasion was in vain","For the ears of the inhabitants","Were witherd deafend cold","And their eyes could not discern","Their brethren of other cities","So Fuzon calld all together","The remaining children of Urizen","And they left the pendulous earth","They called it Egypt left it","And the salt ocean rolled englobd",null];

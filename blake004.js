BLAKE004 = ["Five windows light the cavernd Man thro one he breathes the air","Thro one hears music of the spheres thro one the eternal vine","Flourishes that he may recieve the grapes thro one can look","And see small portions of the eternal world that ever groweth","Thro one himself pass out what time he please but he will not","For stolen joys are sweet and bread eaten in secret pleasant","So sang a Fairy mocking as he sat on a streakd Tulip","Thinking none saw him when he ceasd I started from the trees","And caught him in my hat as boys knock down a butterfly","How know you this said I small Sir where did you learn this song","Seeing himself in my possession thus he answered me","My master I am yours command me for I must obey","Then tell me what is the material world and is it dead","He laughing answerd I will write a book on leaves of flowers","If you will feed me on lovethoughts and give me now and then","A cup of sparkling poetic fancies so when I am tipsie","Ill sing to you to this soft lute and shew you all alive","The world when every particle of dust breathes forth its joy","I took him home in my warm bosom as we went along","Wild flowers I gatherd and he shewd me each eternal flower","He laughd aloud to see them whimper because they were pluckd","They hoverd round me like a cloud of incense when I came","Into my parlour and sat down and took my pen to write","My Fairy sat upon the table and dictated EUROPE","The nameless shadowy female rose from out the breast of Orc","Her snaky hair brandishing in the winds of Enitharmon","And thus her voice arose","O mother Enitharmon wilt thou bring forth other sons","To cause my name to vanish that my place may not be found","For I am faint with travel t","Like the dark cloud disburdend in the day of dismal thunder","My roots are brandishd in the heavens my fruits in earth beneath","Surge foam and labour into life first born and first consumd","Consumed and consuming","Then why shouldst thou accursed mother bring me into life","I wrap my turban of thick clouds around my labring head","And fold the sheety waters as a mantle round my limbs","Yet the red sun and moon","And all the overflowing stars rain down prolific pains","Unwilling I look up to heaven unwilling count the stars","Sitting in fathomless abyss of my immortal shrine","I sieze their burning power","And bring forth howling terrors all devouring fiery kings","Devouring and devoured roaming on dark and desolate mountains","In forests of eternal death shrieking in hollow trees","Ah mother Enitharmon","Stamp not with solid form this vigrous progeny of fires","I bring forth from my teeming bosom myriads of flames","And thou dost stamp them with a signet then they roam abroad","And leave me void as death","Ah I am drownd in shady woe and visionary joy","And who shall bind the infinite with an eternal band","To compass it with swaddling bands and who shall cherish it","With milk and honey","I see it smile and I roll inward and my voice is past","She ceast and rolld her shady clouds","Into the secret place","The deep of winter came","What time the secret child","Descended thro the orient gates of the eternal day","War ceasd and all the troops like shadows fled to their abodes","Then Enitharmon saw her sons and daughters rise around","Like pearly clouds they meet together in the crystal house","And Los possessor of the moon joyd in the peaceful night","Thus speaking while his numrous sons shook their bright fiery wings","Again the night is come t","That strong Urthona takes his rest","And Urizen unloosd from chains","Glows like a meteor in the distant north","Stretch forth your hands and strike the elemental strings","Awake the thunders of the deep","The shrill winds wake","Till all the sons of Urizen look out and envy Los","Sieze all the spirits of life and bind","Their warbling joys to our loud strings","Bind all the nourishing sweets of earth","To give us bliss that we may drink the sparkling wine of Los","And let us laugh at war","Despising toil and care","Because the days and nights of joy in lucky hours renew","Arise O Orc from thy deep den","First born of Enitharmon rise","And we will crown thy head with garlands of the ruddy vine","For now thou art bound","And I may see thee in the hour of bliss my eldest born","The horrent Demon rose surrounded with red stars of fire","Whirling about in furious circles round the immortal fiend","Then Enitharmon down descended into his red light","And thus her voice rose to her children the distant heavens reply","Now comes the night of Enitharmons joy","Who shall I call Who shall I send","That Woman lovely Woman may have dominion","Arise O Rintrah thee I call and Palamabron thee","Go tell the human race that Womans love is Sin","That an Eternal life awaits the worms of sixty winters","In an allegorical abode where existence hath never come","Forbid all joy and from her childhood shall the little female","Spread nets in every secret path","My weary eyelids draw towards the evening my bliss is yet but new","Arise O Rintrah eldest born second to none but Orc","O lion Rintrah raise thy fury from thy forests black","Bring Palamabron horned priest skipping upon the mountains","And silent Elynittria the silver bowed queen","Rintrah where hast thou hid thy bride","Weeps she in desart shades","Alas my Rintrah bring the lovely jealous Ocalythron","Arise my son bring all thy brethren O thou king of fire","Prince of the sun I see thee with thy innumerable race","Thick as the summer stars","But each ramping his golden mane shakes","And thine eyes rejoice because of strength O Rintrah furious king","Enitharmon slept","Eighteen hundred years Man was a Dream","The night of Nature and their harps unstrung","She slept in middle of her nightly song","Eighteen hundred years a female dream","Shadows of men in fleeting bands upon the winds t","Divide the heavens of Europe","Till Albions Angel smitten with his own plagues fled with his bands","The cloud bears hard on Albions shore","Filld with immortal demons of futurity","In council gather the smitten Angels of Albion","The cloud bears hard upon the council house down rushing","On the heads of Albions Angels","One hour they lay buried beneath the ruins of that hall","But as the stars rise from the salt lake they arise in pain","In troubled mists oerclouded by the terrors of strugling times","In thoughts perturbd they rose from the bright ruins silent following","The fiery King who sought his ancient temple serpentformd","That stretches out its shady length along the Island white","Round him rolld his clouds of war silent the Angel went","Along the infinite shores of Thames to golden Verulam","There stand the venerable porches that hightowering rear","Their oaksurrounded pillars formd of massy stones uncut","With tool stones precious such eternal in the heavens","Of colours twelve few known on earth give light in the opake","Placd in the order of the stars when the five senses whelmd","In deluge oer the earthborn man then turnd the fluxile eyes","Into two stationary orbs concentrating all things","The evervarying spiral ascents to the heavens of heavens","Were bended downward and the nostrils golden gates shut","Turnd outward barrd and petrifyd against the infinite","Thought changd the infinite to a serpent that which pitieth","To a devouring flame and man fled from its face and hid","In forests of night then all the eternal forests were divided","Into earths rolling in circles of space that like an ocean rushd","And overwhelmed all except this finite wall of flesh","Then was the serpent temple formd image of infinite","Shut up in finite revolutions and man became an Angel","Heaven a mighty circle turning God a tyrant crownd","Now arrivd the ancient Guardian at the southern porch","That planted thick with trees of blackest leaf and in a vale","Obscure inclosd the Stone of Night oblique it stood oerhung","With purple flowers and berries red image of that sweet south","Once open to the heavens and elevated on the human neck","Now overgrown with hair and coverd with a stony roof","Downward tis sunk beneath th attractive north that round the feet","A raging whirlpool draws the dizzy enquirer to his grave","Albions Angel rose upon the Stone of Night","He saw Urizen on the Atlantic","And his brazen Book","That Kings and Priests had copied on Earth","Expanded from North to South","And the clouds and fires pale rolld round in the night of Enitharmon","Round Albions cliffs and Londons walls still Enitharmon slept","Rolling volumes of grey mist involve Churches Palaces Towers","For Urizen unclaspd his Book feeding his soul with pity","The youth of England hid in gloom curse the paind heavens compelld","Into the deadly night to see the form of Albions Angel","Their parents brought them forth and aged ignorance preaches canting","On a vast rock percievd by those senses that are closd from thought","Bleak dark abrupt it stands and overshadows London city","They saw his boney feet on the rock the flesh consumd in flames","They saw the Serpent temple lifted above shadowing the Island white","They heard the voice of Albions Angel howling in flames of Orc","Seeking the trump of the last doom","Above the rest the howl was heard from Westminster louder and louder","The Guardian of the secret codes forsook his ancient mansion","Driven out by the flames of Orc his furrd robes and false locks","Adhered and grew one with his flesh and nerves and veins shot thro them","With dismal torment sick hanging upon the wind he fled","Groveling along Great George Street thro the Park gate all the soldiers","Fled from his sight he dragd his torments to the wilderness","Thus was the howl thro Europe","For Orc rejoicd to hear the howling shadows","But Palamabron shot his lightnings trenching down his wide back","And Rintrah hung with all his legions in the nether deep","Enitharmon laughd in her sleep to see O womans triumph","Every house a den every man bound the shadows are filld","With spectres and the windows wove over with curses of iron","Over the doors Thou shalt not and over the chimneys Fear is written","With bands of iron round their necks fastend into the walls","The citizens in leaden gyves the inhabitants of suburbs","Walk heavy soft and bent are the bones of villagers","Between the clouds of Urizen the flames of Orc roll heavy","Around the limbs of Albions Guardian his flesh consuming","Howlings and hissings shrieks and groans and voices of despair","Arise around him in the cloudy t","Heavens of Albion Furious","The red limbd Angel siezd in horror and torment","The Trump of the last doom but he could not blow the iron tube","Thrice he assayd presumptuous to awake the dead to Judgment","A mighty Spirit leapd from the land of Albion","Namd Newton he siezd the Trump and blowd the enormous blast","Yellow as leaves of Autumn the myriads of Angelic hosts","Fell thro the wintry skies seeking their graves","Rattling their hollow bones in howling and lamentation","Then Enitharmon woke nor knew that she had slept t","And eighteen hundred years were fled","As if they had not been","She calld her sons and daughters","To the sports of night","Within her crystal house","And thus her song proceeds","Arise Ethinthus tho the earthworm call","Let him call in vain","Till the night of holy shadows","And human solitude is past","Ethinthus queen of waters how thou shinest in the sky","My daughter how do I rejoice for thy children flock around","Like the gay fishes on the wave when the cold moon drinks the dew","Ethinthus thou art sweet as comforts to my fainting soul","For now thy waters warble round the feet of Enitharmon","ManathuVorcyon I behold thee flaming in my halls","Light of thy mothers soul I see thy lovely eagles round","Thy golden wings are my delight and thy flames of soft delusion","Where is my lureing bird of Eden Leutha silent love","Leutha the many colourd bow delights upon thy wings","Soft soul of flowers Leutha","Sweet smiling pestilence I see thy blushing light","Thy daughters many changing","Revolve like sweet perfumes ascending O Leutha silken queen","Where is the youthful Antamon prince of the pearly dew","O Antamon why wilt thou leave thy mother Enitharmon","Alone I see thee crystal form","Floting upon the bosomd air","With lineaments of gratified desire","My Antamon the seven churches of Leutha seek thy love","I hear the soft Oothoon in Enitharmons tents","Why wilt thou give up womans secrecy my melancholy child","Between two moments bliss is ripe","O Theotormon robbd of joy I see thy salt tears flow","Down the steps of my crystal house","Sotha and Thiralatha secret dwellers of dreamful caves","Arise and please the horrent fiend with your melodious songs","Still all your thunders golden hoofd and bind your horses black","Orc smile upon my children","Smile son of my afflictions","Arise O Orc and give our mountains joy of thy red light","She ceasd for All were forth at sport beneath the solemn moon t","Waking the stars of Urizen with their immortal songs","That nature felt thro all her pores the enormous revelry","Till morning oped the eastern gate t","Then every one fled to his station and Enitharmon wept","But terrible Orc when he beheld the morning in the east","Shot from the heights of Enitharmon","And in the vineyards of red France appeard the light of his fury","The sun glowd fiery red","The furious terrors flew around","On golden chariots raging with red wheels dropping with blood","The Lions lash their wrathful tails","The Tigers couch upon the prey and suck the ruddy tide","And Enitharmon groans and cries in anguish and dismay","Then Los arose his head he reard in snaky thunders clad","And with a cry that shook all nature to the utmost pole","Calld all his sons to the strife of blood"];

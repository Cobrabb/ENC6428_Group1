BLAKE002 = ["Lo a shadow of horror is risen","Times on times he divided measurd","For he strove in battles dire","Dark revolving in silent activity","But Eternals beheld his vast forests","His cold horrors silent dark Urizen","Earth was not nor globes of attraction","The sound of a trumpet the heavens","Shrill the trumpet myriads of Eternity","From the depths of dark solitude From","First I fought with the fire consumd","Here alone I in books formd of metals","Lo I unfold my darkness and on","Laws of peace of love of unity","The voice ended they saw his pale visage","Rage fury intense indignation","Sundring darkning thundring","The roaring fires ran oer the heavns","But no light from the fires all was darkness","In fierce anguish quenchless flames","And a roof vast petrific around","And Los round the dark globe of Urizen","Los wept howling around the dark Demon","But Urizen laid in a stony sleep","The Eternals said What is this Death","Los howld in a dismal stupor","But the wrenching of Urizen heald not","Till Los rouzd his fires affrighted","Los smitten with astonishment","And at the surging sulphureous","In whirlwinds pitch nitre","And Los formed nets gins","He watchd in shuddring fear","And these were the changes of Urizen","Ages on ages rolld over him","And Urizen so his eternal name","The eternal mind bounded began to roll","Forgetfulness dumbness necessity","Restless turnd the immortal inchaind","In a horrible dreamful slumber","From the caverns of his jointed Spine","In harrowing fear rolling round","The pangs of hope began","In ghastly torment sick","In ghastly torment sick","Enraged stifled with torment","All the myriads of Eternity","And now his eternal life","Shuddring the Eternal Prophet smote","Ages on ages rolld over them","Los wept obscurd with mourning","In anguish dividing dividing","The globe of life blood trembled","All Eternity shudderd at sight","Wonder awe fear astonishment","Spread a Tent with strong curtains around them","They began to weave curtains of darkness","But Los saw the Female pitied","Eternity shudderd when they saw","A time passed over the Eternals","Yet helpless it lay like a Worm","All day the worm lay on her bosom","Coild within Enitharmons womb","The Eternals their tent finished","A shriek ran thro Eternity","Delving earth in his resistless way","The Eternals closed the tent","In his hands he siezd the infant","They named the child Orc he grew","Los awoke her O sorrow pain","These falling down on the rock","They took Orc to the top of a mountain","The dead heard the voice of the child","And Urizen craving with hunger","He formd a line a plummet","He formed scales to weigh","But Los encircled Enitharmon","And she bore an enormous race","Urizen explord his dens","And his world teemd vast enormities","Most Urizen sickend to see","He in darkness closd viewd all his race","For he saw that life livd upon death","Cold he wanderd on high over their cities","Till a Web dark cold throughout all","So twisted the cords so knotted","And all calld it The Net of Religion","Then the Inhabitants of those Cities","Till the shrunken eyes clouded over","Six days they shrunk up from existence","And their thirty cities divided","And their children wept built","And the thirty cities remaind","The remaining sons of Urizen","So Fuzon calld all together","And the salt ocean rolled englobd","Fuzon on a chariot ironwingd","On spiked flames rose his hot visage","Flamd furious sparkles his hair and beard","Shot down his wide bosom and shoulders","On clouds of smoke rages his chariot","And his right hand burns red in its cloud","Moulding into a vast globe his wrath","As the thunderstone is moulded","Son of Urizens silent burnings","Shall we worship this Demon of smoke","Said Fuzon this abstract nonentity","This cloudy God seated on waters","Now seen now obscurd King of sorrow","So he spoke in a fiery flame","On Urizen frowning indignant","The Globe of wrath shaking on high","Roaring with fury he threw","The howling Globe burning it flew","Lengthning into a hungry beam Swiftly","Opposd to the exulting flamd beam","The broad Disk of Urizen upheavd","Across the Void many a mile","It was forgd in mills where the winter","Beats incessant ten winters the disk","Unremitting endurd the cold hammer","But the strong arm that sent it rememberd","The sounding beam laughing it tore through","That beaten mass keeping its direction","The cold loins of Urizen dividing","Dire shriekd his invisible Lust","Deep groand Urizen stretching his awful hand","Ahania so name his parted soul","He siezd on his mountains of jealousy","He groand anguishd and called her Sin","Kissing her and weeping over her","Then hid her in darkness in silence","Jealous tho she was invisible","She fell down a faint shadow wandring","In chaos and circling dark Urizen","As the moon anguishd circles the earth","Hopeless abhorrd a deathshadow","Unseen unbodied unknown","The mother of Pestilence","But the fiery beam of Fuzon","Was a pillar of fire to Egypt","Five hundred years wandring on earth","Till Los siezd it and beat in a mass","With the body of the sun","But the forehead of Urizen gathering","And his eyes pale with anguish his lips","Blue and changing in tears and bitter","Contrition he prepard his Bow","Formd of Ribs that in his dark solitude","When obscurd in his forests fell monsters","Arose For his dire Contemplations","Rushd down like floods from his mountains","In torrents of mud settling thick","With Eggs of unnatural production","Forthwith hatching some howld on his hills","Some in vales some aloft flew in air","Of these an enormous dread Serpent","Scaled and poisonous horned","Approachd Urizen even to his knees","As he sat on his dark rooted Oak","With his horns he pushd furious","Great the conflict and great the jealousy","In cold poisons but Urizen smote him","First he poisond the rocks with his blood","Then polishd his ribs and his sinews","Dried laid them apart till winter","Then a Bow black prepard on this Bow","A poisoned rock placd in silence","He utterd these words to the Bow","O Bow of the clouds of secresy","O nerve of that lust formd monster","Send this rock swift invisible thro","The black clouds on the bosom of Fuzon","So saying In torment of his wounds","He bent the enormous ribs slowly","A circle of darkness then fixed","The sinew in its rest then the Rock","Poisonous source placd with art lifting difficult","Its weighty bulk silent the rock lay","While Fuzon his tygers unloosing","Thought Urizen slain by his wrath","I am God said he eldest of things","Sudden sings the rock swift and invisible","On Fuzon flew enterd his bosom","His beautiful visage his tresses","That gave light to the mornings of heaven","Were smitten with darkness deformd","And outstretchd on the edge of the forest","But the rock fell upon the Earth","Mount Sinai in Arabia","I The Globe shook and Urizen seated","On black clouds his sore wound anointed","The ointment flowd down on the void","Mixd with blood here the snake gets her poison","With difficulty and great pain Urizen","Lifted on high the dead corse","On his shoulders he bore it to where","A Tree hung over the Immensity","For when Urizen shrunk away","From Eternals he sat on a rock","Barren a rock which himself","From redounding fancies had petrified","Many tears fell on the rock","Many sparks of vegetation","Soon shot the pained root","Of Mystery under his heel","It grew a thick tree he wrote","In silence his book of iron","Till the horrid plant bending its boughs","Grew to roots when it felt the earth","And again sprung to many a tree","Amazd started Urizen when","He beheld himself compassed round","And high roofed over with trees","He arose but the stems stood so thick","He with difficulty and great pain","Brought his Books all but the Book","Of iron from the dismal shade","The Tree still grows over the Void","Enrooting itself all around","An endless labyrinth of woe","The corse of his first begotten","On the accursed Tree of MYSTERY","On the topmost stem of this Tree","Urizen naild Fuzons corse","Forth flew the arrows of pestilence","Round the pale living Corse on the tree","For in Urizens slumbers of abstraction","In the infinite ages of Eternity","When his Nerves of joy melted and flowd","A white Lake on the dark blue air","In perturbd pain and dismal torment","Now stretching out now swift conglobing","Effluvia vapord above","In noxious clouds these hoverd thick","Over the disorganizd Immortal","Till petrific pain scurfd oer the Lakes","As the bones of man solid and dark","The clouds of disease hoverd wide","Around the Immortal in torment","Perching around the hurtling bones","Disease on disease shape on shape","Winged screaming in blood and torment","The Eternal Prophet beat on his anvils","Enragd in the desolate darkness","He forgd nets of iron around","And Los threw them around the bones","The shapes screaming flutterd vain","Some combind into muscles and glands","Some organs for craving and lust","Most remaind on the tormented void","Urizens army of horrors","Round the pale living Corse on the Tree","Forty years flew the arrows of pestilence","Wailing and terror and woe","Ran thro all his dismal world","Forty years all his sons and daughters","Felt their skulls harden then Asia","Arose in the pendulous deep","They reptilize upon the Earth","Fuzon groand on the Tree","The lamenting voice of Ahania","Weeping upon the void","And round the Tree of Fuzon","Distant in solitary night","Her voice was heard but no form","Had she but her tears from clouds","Eternal fell round the Tree","And the voice cried Ah Urizen Love","Flower of morning I weep on the verge","Of Nonentity how wide the Abyss","Between Ahania and thee","I lie on the verge of the deep","I see thy dark clouds ascend","I see thy black forests and floods","A horrible waste to my eyes","Weeping I walk over rocks","Over dens and thro valleys of death","Why didst thou despise Ahania","To cast me from thy bright presence","Into the World of Loneness","I cannot touch his hand","Nor weep on his knees nor hear","His voice and bow nor see his eyes","And joy nor hear his footsteps and","My heart leap at the lovely sound","I cannot kiss the place","Whereon his bright feet have trod","But I wander on the rocks","With hard necessity","Where is my golden palace","Where my ivory bed","Where the joy of my morning hour","Where the sons of eternity singing","To awake bright Urizen my king","To arise to the mountain sport","To the bliss of eternal valleys","To awake my king in the morn","To embrace Ahanias joy","On the bredth of his open bosom","From my soft cloud of dew to fall","In showers of life on his harvests","When he gave my happy soul","To the sons of eternal joy","When he took the daughters of life","Into my chambers of love","When I found babes of bliss on my beds","And bosoms of milk in my chambers","Filld with eternal seed","O eternal births sung round Ahania","In interchange sweet of their joys","Swelld with ripeness and fat with fatness","Bursting on winds my odors","My ripe figs and rich pomegranates","In infant joy at thy feet","O Urizen sported and sang","Then thou with thy lap full of seed","With thy band full of generous fire","Walked forth from the clouds of morning","On the virgins of springing joy","On the human soul to cast","The seed of eternal science","The sweat poured down thy temples","To Ahania returnd in evening","The moisture awoke to birth","My mothers joys sleeping in bliss","But now alone over rocks mountains","Cast out from thy lovely bosom","Cruel jealousy selfish fear","Self destroying how can delight","Renew in these chains of darkness","Where bones of beasts are strown","On the bleak and snowy mountains","Where bones from the birth are buried","Sitting beneath the eternal Oak","O Times remote","But Covet was poured full","Till Covet broke his locks and bars","Raging furious the flames of desire","Ragd with curses and sparkles of fury","Wide apart stood the fires Los remaind","The Immortal stood frozen amidst","Till impatience no longer could bear","Crackd across into numberless fragments","Hurld apart on all sides as a falling","Falling falling Los fell and fell","The Immortal revolving indignant","Many ages of groans till there grew","Till in process from falling he bore","Incessant the falling Mind labourd","The Lungs heave incessant dull and heavy","And the unformed part cravd repose","He arose on the waters but soon","Then he sunk and around his spent Lungs","He rose on the floods then he smote","Down the heavy sunk cleaving around","Beams conducted by fluid so pure","Upfolding his Fibres together","Circling round the dark Demon with howlings","And first from those infinite fires","Roaring indignant the bright sparks","Oft he quenchd it beneath in the Deeps","Nine ages completed their circles","But no light for the Deep fled away","Till his Brain in a rock and his Heart","Where Satan making to himself Laws from his own identity","A Moment equals a pulsation of the artery","Doubt Self Jealous Watry folly","Struggling thro Earths Melancholy","Naked in Air in Shame and Fear","Blind in Fire with shield and spear","I rent the Veil where the Dead dwell","One Dies Alas the Living and Dead","In Vainglory hatcht and nurst","On the shadows of the Moon","In Times Ocean falling drownd","Holy and cold I clipd the Wings","And in depths of my Dungeons","But when once I did descry","Thro evening shades I haste away","The Door of Death I open found","Thourt my Mother from the Womb"];
